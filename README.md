# Getting Started with Create React App

My own project based on the Heartstone card game API.

The pages are dummies jsut ot show the nav bar and React Router although I may come ba k and add soem functionality to the form at a later date.  The purpose of the project was mainly to furthee my skills using REST API's and Oauth.

The app works as intended

There is  a lot of data in hearthstone so future functinality may be added, such as filtering the search results by card cost or class

Made with React and no libaries, using external css as oppossed to css-in-JS
