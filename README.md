# Getting Started with Create React App

My own project based on the Hearthstone card game API.

The pages are dummies just to show the nav bar and React Router although I may come back and add some functionality to the form at a later date.  The purpose of the project was mainly to further my skills using REST API's and Oauth.

The app works as intended

There is  a lot of data in hearthstone so future functinality may be added, such as filtering the search results by card cost or class

Made with React and no libaries, using external css as oppossed to css-in-JS
